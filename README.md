# notebooks-python
A collection of Jupyter notebooks for my Python courses.
- CEMRACS 2017 17/07/2017-24/08/2017

I try to cite all my references on the top of the notebook. If you
find some code or text that looks familiar to you and you are not in references.
Please [contact me](http://annuaire.math.cnrs.fr/english/?recherche=navaro&labo=).
