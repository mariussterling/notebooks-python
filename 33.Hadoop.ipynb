    "- The Hadoop framework transparently provides applications both reliability and data motion. \n",
    "- Hadoop implements the computational paradigm named **Map/Reduce**, where the application is divided into many small fragments of work, each of which may be executed or re-executed on any node in the cluster. \n",
    "- It provides a distributed file system (HDFS) that stores data on the compute nodes, providing very high aggregate bandwidth across the cluster.\n",
